This is a repository for my Knockoff Spotify CarThing Experiments

What comprises this repo is all the code to make my handmade knockoff spotify carthing work.

At the end this will be code for:
- arduino with screen to display track information, and controls
- code for the middleman that will communicate with foobar2000
- information on how this is all setup



Currently it uses work built by Edo at https://gitlab.com/ed0zer-projects/pyfoobar2k/-/tree/master?ref_type=heads

I'm using his classes, and templates to interface with foobar2000

Current rough images of idea

All the hardware hasn't come in yet so I can't put it all together yet
